# Performance Metrics

Performance metrics measure the speed, efficiency, and stability of your software.

## 1. Response Time

**Description:** The time it takes for a system to respond to a user request.

**Formula:**

* Measured in milliseconds or seconds.

**Additional Information:**

* Low response time indicates good performance.
* It's crucial for user experience.
* It can be measured using tools like load testing software.

## 2. Throughput (Performance)

**Description:** The number of requests or transactions a system can handle per unit of time.

**Formula:**

* Measured in requests per second or transactions per second.

**Additional Information:**

* High throughput indicates system capacity.
* It's important for handling high traffic.
* It helps identify performance bottlenecks.

## 3. Error Rate

**Description:** The percentage of requests that result in errors.

**Formula:**

Error Rate = (Number of errors / Total number of requests) * 100%

**Additional Information:**

* Low error rate indicates system stability.
* It's crucial for reliability.
* It helps identify system problems.

## 4. Resource Utilization

**Description:** Measures the utilization of system resources (CPU, memory, etc.).

**Formula:**

* Measured as a percentage of total resource capacity.

**Additional Information:**

* High utilization can indicate performance bottlenecks.
* It helps optimize resource allocation.
* It helps to predict future needs.

## 5. Latency

**Description:** The time it takes for data to travel from one point to another.

**Formula:**

* Measured in milliseconds or seconds.

**Additional Information:**

* Low Latency is important for real time application.
* High latency is a problem for online gaming, and video streaming.
