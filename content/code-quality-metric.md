# Code Quality Metrics

Code quality metrics help ensure the maintainability, reliability, and robustness of your software.

## 1. Code Coverage

**Description:** Code coverage measures the percentage of your code that is executed by automated tests.

**Formula:**

Code Coverage = (Number of lines covered by tests / Total number of lines) * 100%

**Additional Information:**

* High code coverage indicates thorough testing.
* It helps identify untested code areas.
* Different types of coverage (line, branch, etc.) exist.

## 2. Cyclomatic Complexity

**Description:** Cyclomatic complexity measures the complexity of a program's control flow.

**Formula:**

Cyclomatic Complexity = E - N + 2P
(E = edges, N = nodes, P = connected components)

**Additional Information:**

* High complexity can lead to difficult-to-maintain code.
* It helps identify code that needs refactoring.
* Tools like SonarQube can calculate this.

## 3. Code Duplication

**Description:** Code duplication measures the amount of identical or near-identical code in your codebase.

**Formula:**

* Calculated by tools that identify duplicated code blocks.

**Additional Information:**

* Duplication increases maintenance costs.
* It can lead to inconsistencies and bugs.
* Refactoring can reduce duplication.

## 4. Static Code Analysis Findings

**Description:** Reports from static analysis tools that identify potential code issues without executing the code.

**Formula:**

* Varies based on the specific analysis tool.

**Additional Information:**

* Tools like ESLint, SonarQube, and Checkstyle are used.
* They help find bugs, security vulnerabilities, and style violations.
* They improve code quality early in the development process.

## 5. Maintainability Index

**Description:** A calculated value representing how easy it is to maintain code.

**Formula:**

* Calculated by static analysis tools based on various factors.

**Additional Information:**

* Higher index values indicate better maintainability.
* It helps prioritize refactoring efforts.
* It can be used to track maintainability over time.
