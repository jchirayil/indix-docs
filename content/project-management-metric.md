# Project Management Metrics

Project management metrics are essential for tracking progress, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring projects stay on schedule and within budget.

## 1. Velocity {#velocity}

**Description:** Velocity measures the amount of work a team completes per sprint or iteration. It's typically calculated in story points or other units of effort.

**Formula:**

Velocity = Sum of completed story points in a sprint

**Additional Information:**

* Velocity is used to forecast future sprint capacity.
* It helps teams plan realistic sprint goals.
* Consistent velocity indicates a stable team.
* Spikes or dips in velocity can signal process issues.

## 2. Burndown/Burnup Charts

**Description:** These charts visualize the remaining work in a sprint or project over time. Burndown shows remaining work decreasing, while burnup shows completed work increasing.

**Formula:**

* **Burndown:**

Remaining Work = Total Work - Completed Work

* **Burnup:**

Completed Work (plotted over time)

**Additional Information:**

* Burndown charts help track daily progress.
* Burnup charts are useful for projects with scope changes.
* Deviations from the ideal line indicate potential delays.

## 3. Lead Time

**Description:** Lead time is the total time it takes for a task to move from initiation to completion.

**Formula:**

Lead Time = Time of Completion - Time of Initiation

**Additional Information:**

* Lead time helps identify bottlenecks in the workflow.
* Reducing lead time improves delivery speed.
* It's crucial for understanding the overall efficiency.

## 4. Cycle Time

**Description:** Cycle time measures the time it takes to complete a specific task or feature from when work begins on it.

**Formula:**

Cycle Time = Time of Completion - Time Work Begins

**Additional Information:**

* Cycle time focuses on the actual development time.
* It helps optimize individual development processes.
* Lower cycle time often results in faster feedback loops.

## 5. Throughput (Project Management)

**Description:** Throughput is the number of tasks or features completed within a specific timeframe.

**Formula:**

Throughput = Number of completed tasks / Time period

**Additional Information:**

* Throughput measures the team's output.
* It helps identify productivity trends.
* It can be affected by factors like team size and complexity.
