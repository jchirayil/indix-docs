# Testing Metrics

Testing metrics provide insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of your testing processes.

## 1. Test Case Pass/Fail Rate

**Description:** The percentage of test cases that pass or fail during testing.

**Formula:**

Pass Rate = (Number of passed test cases / Total number of test cases) * 100%
Fail Rate = (Number of failed test cases / Total number of test cases) * 100%

**Additional Information:**

* High pass rate indicates software quality.
* Fail rates help identify problem areas.
* It's essential to track pass/fail rates over time.

## 2. Defect Density

**Description:** The number of defects found per unit of code.

**Formula:**

Defect Density = Number of defects / Size of code (e.g., lines of code)

**Additional Information:**

* Lower defect density indicates higher code quality.
* It helps compare the quality of different code modules.
* It can be used to track quality improvements.

## 3. Test Coverage (Testing)

**Description:** Measures how much of the application has been tested.

**Formula:**

* This is the same as code coverage, but in testing it is used to measure the applications features that have been tested.

**Additional Information:**

* Helps to ensure all areas of the application are tested.
* Important for regression testing.

## 4. Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)

**Description:** The average time a system operates before failing.

**Formula:**

MTTF = Total uptime / Number of failures

**Additional Information:**

* High MTTF indicates system reliability.
* It's crucial for critical systems.
* It helps plan maintenance and upgrades.

## 5. Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)

**Description:** The average time it takes to restore a system after a failure.

**Formula:**

MTTR = Total downtime / Number of failures

**Additional Information:**

* Low MTTR indicates efficient recovery processes.
* It's crucial for minimizing downtime.
* It helps assess the effectiveness of incident response.
