# Welcome to KPI/OKR Docs

This documentation provides comprehensive information on key performance indicators (KPIs) and objectives and key results (OKRs) commonly used in software engineering projects. It aims to serve as a resource for teams looking to improve their development processes, code quality, and overall project success.

## Project Management Metrics

* **[Velocity](project-management-metric#velocity)**: Measures the amount of work a team completes per sprint.
* **[Burndown/Burnup Charts](project-management-metric#burndown-burnup-charts)**: Visual representations of remaining work over time.
* **[Lead Time](project-management-metric#lead-time)**: Time from task initiation to completion.
* **[Cycle Time](project-management-metric#cycle-time)**: Time to complete a specific task.
* **[Throughput (Project Management)](project-management-metric#throughput-project-management)**: Number of tasks completed within a timeframe.

## Code Quality Metrics

* **[Code Coverage](code-quality-metric#code-coverage)**: Percentage of code covered by tests.
* **[Cyclomatic Complexity](code-quality-metric#cyclomatic-complexity)**: Measures code complexity.
* **[Code Duplication](code-quality-metric#code-duplication)**: Amount of duplicated code.
* **[Static Code Analysis Findings](code-quality-metric#static-code-analysis-findings)**: Reports from static analysis tools.
* **[Maintainability Index](code-quality-metric#maintainability-index)**: Measures code maintainability.

## Testing Metrics

* **[Test Case Pass/Fail Rate](testing-metric#test-case-pass-fail-rate)**: Percentage of passed/failed test cases.
* **[Defect Density](testing-metric#defect-density)**: Number of defects per unit of code.
* **[Test Coverage (Testing)](testing-metric#test-coverage-testing)**: Measures how much of the application has been tested.
* **[Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)](testing-metric#mean-time-to-failure-mttf)**: Average time a system operates before failing.
* **[Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)](testing-metric#mean-time-to-recovery-mttr)**: Average time to restore a system after failure.

## Performance Metrics

* **[Response Time](performance-metric#response-time)**: Time for a system to respond to a request.
* **[Throughput (Performance)](performance-metric#throughput-performance)**: Number of requests handled per time.
* **[Error Rate](performance-metric#error-rate)**: Percentage of requests resulting in errors.
* **[Resource Utilization](performance-metric#resource-utilization)**: Utilization of system resources.
* **[Latency](performance-metric#latency)**: Time for data to travel.

## User Metrics

* **[Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)](user-metric#customer-satisfaction-csat)**: Measures customer satisfaction.
* **[Net Promoter Score (NPS)](user-metric#net-promoter-score-nps)**: Measures customer loyalty.
* **[User Engagement](user-metric#user-engagement)**: Measures user interaction.
* **[Feature Usage](user-metric#feature-usage)**: Measures usage of specific features.
* **[User Retention](user-metric#user-retention)**: Measures user retention over time.

## Startup KPI

* **[Runway](startup-kpi#runway)**: Number of months a startup can operate before running out of cash.
* **[Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)](startup-kpi#monthly-recurring-revenue-mrr)**: Predictable subscription-based revenue each month.
* **[Activation Rate](startup-kpi#activation-rate)**: Percentage of users complete onboarding process.
* **[Monthly Burn](startup-kpi#monthly-burn)**: Amount of cash spent per month.
